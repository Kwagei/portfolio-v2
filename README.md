KIT-Cohort-III CSS Portfolio Project

This is a CSS-based project for week-I of your CSS course. It is intended to build up and reinforce your CSS skills. You wouldn't need Javascript for most of the work you will be doing, but feel free to implement Javascript if the need arises.

The due date for this project is December 3, 2023, at 3pm.

Best wishes and happy coding!
